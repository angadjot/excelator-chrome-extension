# Excelator Chrome Extention

Excelator is a chrome extention developed using React. This plugin accepts a xml, xls, xlsx file and converts the data in the file to Json. Once the xml/xlsx file is parsed, the user is provided option to download the file containing parsed json.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

To build the project, you will need to have node.js/npm installed in your system. The best way to do it according to me is using nvm.
You can follow the below link for Mac OS Installation of Nvm.
